        <p><em>Staff QA Engineer at <strong>Commscope</strong></em></p>
        <p>
            As a staff QA enginner I am responsible for the testing of the 'Halo' Domain Manager product. My chef responsibility is to write new automated test cases 
            for the Domain Manager as new features are added as well as any maintenance tasks associated with the automated test suite. We make use of the <em>Pytest</em> 
            automation framework which as it's name would suggest is Python based.
